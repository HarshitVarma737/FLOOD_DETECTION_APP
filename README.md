# ðŸŒŠ Smart Flood Detection System
A web-based ML-powered flood detection system that takes environmental inputs and predicts the possibility of a flood using trained models.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time prediction using a trained **Random Forest Classifier**
- Beautiful UI with **sea-wave animated background**
- Inputs include temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Displays prediction (`Flood` or `No Flood`) and confidence score
- Input validation to ensure all fields are filled
